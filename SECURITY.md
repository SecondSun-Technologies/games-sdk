# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We at SecondSun Technologies take security concerns extremely seriously. Please email us directly at "sysadmin@secondsuntech.com", rather than making a GitHub issue due to the nature of security concerns.
We will respond next business day. If we don't, or you don't feel like your concern was taken seriously, open a GitHub issue.
